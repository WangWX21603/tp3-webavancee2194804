Proclaimed a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, Charlevoix owes its astonishing geography to the fall of a 15 billion ton meteorite 350 million years ago.
During the winter, the backcountry turns into a superb playground for snowmobile raid enthusiasts.", 2),

Immerse yourself in the spectacular panoramas of the Gaspesie, where the sea, beaches, cliffs, mountains and rivers compete for the leading role. Chat with his people, with an easy smile and wide open arms.
Pop into its many restaurants and shops; devour its marine, agricultural and forest treasures. Dance, sing or relax until the wee hours under an infinitely starry sky! Ready for the big adventure?", 1),
(5, "Go to Montreal", "Montreal begins as a large American city, with its immense network of highways that hugs the skyscrapers and plunges into the heart of wide avenues cut at right angles.
But on closer inspection, Montreal is more like a wonderful patchwork (sorry for the anglicism!) of neighborhoods with a very different family atmosphere. No need to walk miles of asphalt to move from one world to another: to taste successively the sweet excitement of a Downtown given over to office workers during the day and almost deserted at night, to the relaxed atmosphere of streets of the Plateau and the Mile-End, or the alternative and bubbling vibrations of the Mile Ex, unless you let yourself be seduced by the Chinese district or are frankly carried away by the festive mood of the Latin Quarter or downright crazy in the Gay Village.", 2),

To discover this gem, however, you will need time and also a certain amount of money. Expeditions to this territory are rather expensive, but totally worth the cost! Departures are from Montreal and Nunavik.", 2);
